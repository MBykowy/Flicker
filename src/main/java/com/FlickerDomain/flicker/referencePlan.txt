### High-Level Plan for Implementing Blocking Functionality

1. **Database Changes**:
   - Add a new entity `Block` to represent the blocking relationship between users.
   - Update the `User` entity to include relationships for blocked users and users who have blocked them.

2. **Backend Changes**:
   - Create a `BlockRepository` to handle CRUD operations for the `Block` entity.
   - Implement a `BlockService` to manage the business logic for blocking and unblocking users.
   - Update the `PostService` and other relevant services to filter out posts and interactions from blocked users.
   - Update the `PostController` and other relevant controllers to include endpoints for blocking and unblocking users.

3. **Frontend Changes**:
   - Modify the `MainPage.js` to include functionality for blocking users using the existing button.
   - Ensure that blocked users are hidden from the user's view in the UI.
